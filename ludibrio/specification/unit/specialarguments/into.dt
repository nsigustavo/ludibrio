into
~~~~

Verifies if an object is contained (into) another. The contain and include matchers do exactly the same job::


    >>> from ludibrio.matcher import into

    >>> into([1,2,3]) == 1
    True
    >>> into([1,2,3]) == 5
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    ParameterException: 5 is not in [1, 2, 3]

    >>> into([1,2,3]) == 3
    True
